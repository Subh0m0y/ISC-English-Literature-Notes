# English Literature - Notes - ISC 2017

This repository contains notes to the chapters present in the English Literature Syllabus of ISC 2017.

# Structure
The project is structured in the following manner:

```
ISC-English-Literature-Notes
+- [Book name]
  +- [Chapter name]
    +- [Question].docx
    +- [Question].pdf
    +- [Question].txt
```

As an extra, I exported the theme I use in FocusWriter in the appropriate folder.

# Contributing to the project
1. First and foremost, you must be a collaborator. If you are not, request me (Subh0m0y) to make you one through e-mail.
2. Download and install the lastest version of [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Download and install [FocusWriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/). This is to ensure that all collaborators use the same tools, for the sake of uniformity.
4. Choose a location where you would like to place the repository folder. Then open up that location in the terminal or command-line.
5. Type `git clone https://github.com/Subh0m0y/ISC-English-Literature-Notes.git`. **This will create a new directory.**
6. Add a new file or change an existing one (preferrably using FocusWriter).

8. Type `git commit -m "[Comment describing the changes]"`
9. Type `git push -u origin master`. *You will be asked to enter your username and password everytime.*
