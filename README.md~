# Contributing to the project
For the first time, follow these step:
1. First and foremost, you must be a collaborator. If you are not, request me (Subh0m0y) to make you one through e-mail.
2. Download and install the lastest version of [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Download and install [FocusWriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/). This is to ensure that all collaborators use the same tools, for the sake of uniformity. Also, if you want, download the theme at [this location](https://github.com/Subh0m0y/ISC-English-Literature-Notes/blob/master/%5BExtra%5D%20Focus%20Writer%20Themes/Night.fwtz) (click on the **Raw** button). Using it will ensure that the PDFs you export will conform to the standard.
4. Choose a location where you would like to place the repository folder. Then open up that location in the terminal or command-line.
5. Navigate to that folder in the command-line.
6. Type `git clone https://github.com/Subh0m0y/ISC-English-Literature-Notes.git`. **This will create a new directory.**
7. Add a new file or change an existing one (preferrably using FocusWriter).
8. Type `git add *`
9. Type `git commit -m "[Comment describing the changes]"`
10. Type `git push -u origin master`. *You will be asked to enter your username and password everytime.*
11. And you're done!

If you have already committed and pushed once, follow these steps:
1. Open up the terminal and type `git push -u origin master`
2. Make necessary changes or add files.
3. Type `git add *` to add all files.
4. Type `git commit -m "[Comment goes here]"`
5. Type `git push -u origin master`. Enter your username and password.
